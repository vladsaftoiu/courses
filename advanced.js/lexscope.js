//LEXICAL SCOPE
//slide 18

/*
lexical scope -> compile time scope  (lexical from de lex parse phase)
    in .js we always talk about lexical scope because scoping is made at author time
    and does not change at runtime. 
    cheat: using eval(str) will let you (by running str as javascript code) modify the
    scope you are in at run time, making it different regardin to as it was at compile time
